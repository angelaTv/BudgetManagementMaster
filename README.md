# BudgetManagementMaster-PYTHON/DJANGO
A simple project with graph and other reports to see the expense behviour of a user.
This is a python/django project which uses template inheritence,function based and class Views,User authentication,Ajax,Javscript,Ploty 
as visualization tool.

#The way it works
It's pretty simple: The application allows us to add expenses,create category for you to customize your expense and allow you to update,
view and delete for a specific date range.It gives different reports to analyse your expense.This app provides you basically two reports
1)Graph reports =>to find in which category user spends more.[for graph i used Plotly as visualization tool]
2)DateWise Reports=>to find date wise report
other two reports are the sub reports of the above

In the project i have used a good UI than my previous project https://github.com/angelaTv/BudgetProject which is the same project with no 
much UI
